                When all the students follow a precise schedule, it keeps them
                committed to their work and prevents them from leaving tasks
                incomplete. Pen Tutor teachers are trained to guide students
                through every situation, leading them toward the right path. Our
                small group coaching helps students manage emotions caused by
                daily stress and the challenges of college life, using effective
                tools for stress management and emotional regulation.
